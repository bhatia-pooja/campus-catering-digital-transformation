# 🍽 Citrus Grove Catering – Digital Strategy & Ordering Portal Design

This project was completed as part of the MBA Capstone Consulting Program at the University of California, Riverside. Over the course of 10 weeks, our student consulting team partnered with **Citrus Grove Catering (CGC)** to analyze operational inefficiencies and recommend a comprehensive digital transformation strategy—centered around the design and rollout of a new **online ordering portal**.

## 🧭 Project Objectives

Citrus Grove Catering faced growing demand from campus clients but lacked the digital infrastructure to scale efficiently. Key challenges included:

- Manual, email-based ordering processes
- Miscommunication between clients and kitchen staff
- Limited operational visibility
- No 24/7 order access or automated workflows

Our goal was to deliver an actionable solution that improved customer experience, streamlined operations, and supported long-term growth.
